
The heuristic evealuaton function used in the code is hn = fn + gn
where fn is broken down into different permutations of the puzzel plus 
the number of misplaced tiles multiplied by a 100

The A star algorithm is much more faster especially with the first easy puzzle
A star algorithms reaches the goal with ony 13 moves
while the Breadth First reaches the goal with 61 Moves 
the Depth First is the slowest reaching the goal with
576 Moves
